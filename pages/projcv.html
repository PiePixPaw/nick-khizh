          <h2>PURPOSE OF CREATION:</h2>
            
            <p>After taking a course in HTML and CSS, I decided to put the knowledge I had gained into practice, 
              as this is the best way to internalize the theory. Being an enthusiastic and inquisitive person, 
              I decided to create my own resume website.

              Before I started coding, I decided to look at the process from the perspective of a potential employer. 
              I envisioned myself as a recruiter looking for a junior manual tester, 
              and developed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12pgyWSAuJmEMoFLTebLh4I1lGYOfgKYhsn2X3q5mJbU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">USER STORY</a> 
              and a few <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12pgyWSAuJmEMoFLTebLh4I1lGYOfgKYhsn2X3q5mJbU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">USER CASES</a> 
              to better understand how my resume website could make an impression. 
              If you're interested, you can see my research in my Google Sheets by clicking on the green highlighted words in the text.

          <h2>CREATION PROCESS:</h2>
          <section id="section2a">
              <h3>• HTML</h3>
                <p>At the same time as creating user cases, 
                  I sketched the structure in notepad and then quickly transferred it to html using VS editor.
                   And for version control and work on different devices I created a repository in <a href="https://github.com/PiePixPaw/nick-khizh" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 
                   This helped me in the future, as it turned out that GitHub allows you to host the page for free.

          <section id="section2b">
              <h3>• CSS</h3>
                <p>Next, I focused on visual design. To create a layout I chose between Figma, 
                  Photoshop and Canva as I know how to use at a basic level each of them. 
                  But in the end I chose Figma as it was more convenient to create the layout of the site. 
                  Also for the selection of color scheme used the color palettes that I found in Pinterest.

                <img src="..\img\mycv_img\history4.png">
                <p>Having visualized the structure and design I started to implement the layout in practice and I started to add CSS and HTML edits. 
                  But in the process of adding the design was changed and reworked a few more times and finally got the look that you can see now.

          <section id="section2c">
              <h3>• JavaScript</h3>
                <p>To enhance the visual appeal of the site, 
              I utilized JavaScript, borrowing code snippets from various sources online. 
              This allowed me to implement features such as 
              a scroll-to-top button and image enlargement in the "Certificates" section.

      <section id="section3">
          <h2>CHALLANGES ENCOUNTRED:</h2>
            <p>When creating the site I faced various problems: 
              typos - because of which the code did not work the way I wanted,
               searching for hosting, difficulties in implementing the intended functionality and much more. 
            </p>
            <p>I solved all these problems by searching the Internet, 
              studying documentation and researching functionality. 
              I believe that this helped me to get and consolidate a little more knowledge than I got on the theoretical course.

      </section>

      <section id="section4">
          <h2>TESTING:</h2>
            <p>When implementing new functionality, I was constantly testing the application by creating tasks in Trello to monitor the work done and bugs found. 
              Despite the fact that I myself was a developer and tester - all bug reports were made with standards in mind, in order to practice skills.

      <section id="section5">
          <h2>FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:</h2>
            <p>In the future, I plan to expand the functionality of the site, 
            improve its multi-platform optimization (particularly the mobile version, which is currently unsatisfactory), 
            and enhance my JavaScript skills by attempting to write several scripts independently.
